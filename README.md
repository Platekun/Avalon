Avalon is a TypeScript application/library generator with a few opinionated defaults. Use Avalon to quickly scaffold projects that leverage the benefits of using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) as a development environment.

Avalon leverages the practice of [executable containers](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/docker-for-development-service-containers-vs-executable-containers-9fb831775133) to avoid having to configure different node.js versions in your machine.

## Pre-requisites

Before using Avalon we have to make sure we have installed the following software on your machine:

- [üê≥ Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- [üå≥ Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [üêô GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com).
- [‚òÅÔ∏è AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
- [üî¨ jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

Additionally, you can use the following resources in case you need help setting everything up:

- [üå≥ Git's](https://git-scm.com/downloads) [official guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).
- [üêô GitHub CLI's](https://cli.github.com) [official manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/).
- [‚òÅÔ∏è AWS CLI's](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) [Stephane Maarek's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-A84oh4G8).

## Defaults

### Branches

By default Avalon will create two [branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) by default:

- `dev`: Refers to the environment is the branch that engineers write code in.
- `main`: Refers to the environment is the branch that end users interact with.

Both branches are identical when your artifact is freshly created.

üí° **Note**: It is recommended to only push code to these branches via pull requests.

### Git Hooks

[Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are a mean to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur while performing [üå≥ Git](https://git-scm.com) actions. Git hooks are located in the `.git/hooks` where each file represents a different hook.

By default Avalon will create two client-side hooks:

- `pre-commit`: Will format files before `git commit`.
- `pre-push`:
  - Will prevent any `git push` action to `master`/`main`/`dev` branches.
  - Will format files before `git push`.

## Installation

It's as simple as cloning this repository and adding two things to your shell profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```rc
# Needed for avalon to work
export AVALON_PATH="<<path-to-the-cloned-directory>>"

# Creates a global alias so you can execute avalon everywhere (Recommended)
alias avalon="./<<path-to-the-cloned-directory>>/run.sh"
```

After making the changes of the installation step applicable (`source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`, etc.), you can now use Avalon in a new terminal window.

## Quickstart

```shell
avalon new my-cool-typescript-library
```

## Recipes

### Creating a New Barebones Library

Use this recipe to create a [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) library without anykind of Continous Integration (CI) or Continous Delivery (CD) configuration. This is ideal for projects where you do not need the overhead of having a CI/CD steps or you wish to setup our own CI/CD steps.

```shell
avalon new ARTIFACT_NAME --artifact=library --ci-cd="barebones"
```

### Creating a New Library that leverages GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Use this recipe to create a [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) library with a Continous Integration (CI) and Continous Delivery (CD) steps using [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This is ideal for projects where you wish a more solid project foundation with GitHub.

By default, the CI step is triggered by every push and the CD step is triggered by creating new [GitHub releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

üí° **Note**: As a recommendation, releases should be created using the `main` branch.

```shell
avalon new ARTIFACT_NAME --artifact=library --ci-cd="github-actions"
```

### Creating a New Library that leverages AWS (CodeBuild) for CI/CD

Use this recipe to create a [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) library with a Continous Integration (CI) and Continous Delivery (CD) steps using [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/). This is ideal for projects where you wish a more solid project foundation using the AWS ecosystem.

By default, the CI step is triggered by every code change in the repository and the CD step is triggered by merging a pull request from the `dev` branch to the `main` branch.

```shell
avalon new ARTIFACT_NAME --artifact=library --ci-cd="aws"
```

üí° **Note**: You will need to do a setup before making use of the CI/CD pipeline provided by AWS. You can read more about the steps needed in the README of the generated project.
